# 📓 Computational Social Scientist & Python Developer
Specializing in automation workflows, data analysis, data science, and visualization, I blend technical skills with human-centric insights and design. My background spans computational social science, market research, consumer insights reporting, and automation in data management and distribution.


# ✒️ What I'm Working On:

[Tower United:](https://github.com/christophergillard9696-lgtm/Tower-United) A community management project using social research methods to gather & analyze player sentiment, player habits, and spending patterns. Leverages interview recordings and web content to gather actionable insights.

[Cause for Applause:](https://github.com/christophergillard9696-lgtm/Cause-For-Applause) A political science driven project mapping applause timing and sentiment. Includes statistical analysis of pauses and anticipation, sentiment probability timelines, and end-to-end ML Python deep Ai workflows.

(W.I.P) [Home Brew Social Media Market & Consumer Insights Experiment:](https://github.com/christophergillard9696-lgtm/Home-Brew-Social-Media-Market-Consumer-Insights-Experiment/blob/main/README.md) This project explores how data‑driven insight can shape smarter content strategy. By analysing performance data from my own YouTube and TikTok channels, I’m examining which videos & hashtags resonate most with audiences, and how posting times influence reach. 

(W.I.P) [Ai Futures Report:](https://github.com/christophergillard9696-lgtm/Ai-Futures) A business intelligence project looking into the majority use cases of AI and their accompanying markets, exploring sector longevity, public/private sentiment outlook, cultural behaviors, investment economies, and intersections with established industries.

(W.I.P) [Automated Data Management & Exportation Workflows:](https://github.com/christophergillard9696-lgtm/Automation-Designs) A short written piece and flow chart on enhancing Python, SQL, and Power BI skills in cloud environments (Airflow, AWS & Azure) for scalable automated data gathering and conditional ELT & ETL pipelines.


  # ⚙️ Tools I Use:
I build Python tools for web scraping, API integration, and sentiment analysis, using libraries like VADER, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, PyAudio, and SQLAlchemy, utilising MySQL & SQLServer as needed for specific querying, gathering and clean up tasks. I host custom ELT pipelines on Airflow/AWS/Azure (currently learning python for heavy load ETL pipelines), delivering end products like written reports and Power BI dashboards with heavy DAX & measure usage, relational modeling, and conditional formatting as appropriate, data modeling inferred. I have a degree in Anthropology which informs a lot of my research methodology.      
Ultimately my focuses are: Accessibility, Scalability, and Economic Affluency.
