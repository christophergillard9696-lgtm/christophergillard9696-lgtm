# 📓 Computational Social Scientist & Python Developer
Specializing in automation workflows, data analysis, data science, and visualization, I blend technical skills with human-centric insights and design. My background spans computational social science, market research, consumer insights reporting, and automation in data management and distribution.

# ⚙️ Tools I use:
I build Python tools for web scraping, API integration, and personal documentation automation, using libraries like VADER, Pandas, R, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, PyAudio, and SQLAlchemy. I host custom pipelines on AWS/Azure, delivering end products like written reports and Power BI dashboards with DAX, relational modeling, and conditional formatting as appropriate. I have a degree in Anthropology which informs a lot of my research methodology. Ultimately my focuses are: Accessibility, Scalability, and Economic affluency.
